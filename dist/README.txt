Hi! This is my snake remake!
It is not amazing, but it works!
I would like to add some things like changing the colors in game.
But for now this is alright.
This took about 10ish hours to make.
No code is copied from AI, but I did ask AI maybe 2 or 3 times either for concept checking
or the one time I needed to spot an error
that was quite obvious once i saw what it was :p
If you find that your inputs are being eaten well thats's because they are
In order to prevent you from snapping your neck, if you already put an input within the time that the snake moves,
it will not accept any more
And so if you try to put another one it will eat your input.
"But why don't you put an input queue-" shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Anyways try to beat my high score of 50!

Also, if you do somehow beat it, it should just say game over with your maxed out score
But i didn't test it so good luck
